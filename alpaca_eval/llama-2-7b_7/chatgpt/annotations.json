However, the performance of these models has been limited by the lack of ground truth data. In this blog post, we will show how to improve the performance by leveraging human knowledge.\nThe first step is to collect data from multiple sources. This can be done by surveying experts or by using crowdsourcing platforms. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean it and prepare it for training. This includes removing outliers and correcting for bias.\nOnce the data is cleaned and prepared, you can start training the model. The most common approach is to use a supervised learning algorithm such as support vector machines or neural networks. However you can also use unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means clustering.\nAfter training the models, you will need to evaluate their performance. The two most common metrics are accuracy and precision. Accuracy measures how well the model predicts the correct class, while precision measures how often the model correctly predicts a positive class.\nIf you want to improve your instance segment AP metrics, you should start by collecting data from experts and using it to train",

It was the culmination of a long and difficult struggle by African Americans to gain equal rights.\nThe act outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the law.\nIn 1564, the civil war ended and the United States was divided into two countries: the North and the South. The North was predominantly white and the Southern states were mostly black.\nAfter the war, the South became increasingly segregated and black people were denied equal rights and opportunities. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence was signed and the country declared itself free from British rule.\nHowever, the Civil War had left the country divided and many white people were opposed to the idea of black people having equal rights with them.\nDuring the 1600s, African Americans began to move north to escape slavery.

The method is also known as the finite difference method. The concept of finite elements was first introduced in the mid-19th century, and it is now widely used in mathematics. The finite element analysis is used to solve complex mathematical problems that are related to the mechanic of deformation and the material properties. The material properties are defined by the properties of the elasticity, the elasicity is defined by its properties, and the properties are used to define the properties.

It adds types to JavaScript.\n\n- Types are declared at the top of a file.\n- TypeScript has built-in type inference.\n  - Type inference: TypeScript can determine the type of variables by their context.\n    - For example, if you declare a variable of type `number`, TypeScript will infer that it is a number.\n      - If you declare `let x = 10`, TypeSript will infer `x` is a `number`.\n- If you need to explicitly declare the type, you can do so using the `type` keyword.\n  \n## 2. Explaing Duck typing\n\nDuck typing is a programming paradigm that allows programs to operate on objects without knowing their type.\nThis is achieved by using a duck test, which states that if an object looks like a ducks, it must be a duct.\nIn other words, the type can be determined by the behavior of the object.\n",

The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, states that organisms produce more offspring than can survive. As a result, only the fittest survive and the offspring inherit the traits of the parents. However, the theory does not explain how traits are selected for.\nScientists have proposed several theories to explain the process of natural selection. One theory, called sexual selection, states the organisms choose mates based on their physical characteristics. In other words, individuals compete to be chosen by the opposite sex.\nFor example, a male peacock has a brightly colored tail that is used to attract a female. The male peahen is not as brightly coloured as the male and has a duller tail. The peacoccks have evolved to be brightly-coloured as this attracts the females.\nTags: sexual-selection\nThe theory of natural Selection is",

Evolution is the process of adaptation and evolution is the outcome of adaptation. The theory of natural selection is the key concept in Darwin, and the idea of evolution is that the genetic variation is the source of new traits.\nHow does the theory help us understand the development of intelligence?

Examples of these languages include Python, Ruby, and PHP.\nCompiled languages are languages that are compiled into machine code.

Exampes of these include C, C++, and Java.\nJIT-compiled languages (Just-in-time compiled) are those languages that compile the source into machine language on-the-fly. This is done by a specialized JIT compiler that is built into the operating system.

These defects are often formed by the presence of an interstitial atom, which is a non-crystallogenic atom.\nF centers are created when a small cation replaces a larger one.\nThe size of the interstital atom is smaller than the size of a normal atom. This means that the intersital atom has a lower density than the normal atom, so it is more easily displaced.\nIn the case of F-center, the smaller atom is a fluoride.

Landowners also have a right to collect rent and can take legal action if a renter fails to pay rent.\nWhat is the difference between a landlady and a landowner?\nLandladies are women who own and manage rental properties.

    "output_1":"Wireless networks are limited by the laws of physics.  In general, the further you are from the access point, the weaker the signal.  This is because the radio waves travel in a straight line.  If you are located on the opposite side of the house from the router, the radio signal is weak.  You can try to move the router closer to the area of the home that is having trouble, but this may not work if the walls are thick.  The best solution is to use a repeater.  A repeater is a wireless access point that rebroadcasts the signal from the original router.  It will extend the range of the original signal and provide better coverage.  There are several types of repeaters available.  Some are plugged directly into the router and are called powerline repeaters.  Others are standalone devices that are plug-and-play.  They are called mesh repeaters because they create a mesh network.  Mesh networks are very popular for home use because they provide more coverage than powerline or standalone repeaters and are easy to install.

This is in contrast to games that have imperfect information, where the players do not know everything.\nIn Into The Breach, the players are aware of the entire map and the enemies that are on it. They are also aware of their own units and their own power.\nThe concept of perfect information was first introduced by John von Neumann in the 1920s, and was developed further by von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstern in their book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.\nIt is a concept that has been used in many different contexts, including economics, game theory, and artificial intelligence.\nPerfect information is when all players have perfect knowledge of the game state, including all information about the other players and the game itself. This includes information about what each player knows, as well as information about their own actions and the actions of other players.\nWhen players have imperfections in their knowledge, this is known as imperfect knowledge.

The problem is that the showrunners and writers are trying to do too many things at once.\nThe first season is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, which means it\u2019s 3,000 years before the events of The Lord of The Ring. This is a time when the Elves are still young and powerful, and the Dwarves are at the height of their powers.\nHowever, the show\u2019s writers are also trying to set up the events that will lead to the Third Age, which begins with the destruction of N\u00famenor. This means that the writers are constantly trying to juggle two different timelines, which makes it difficult to focus on any one story.\nAnother problem is the show is trying to be too faithful to Tolkien\u2019s original works.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Leonardo Fibonacci introduced the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system to Europe, and his Liber Abaci (1202) popularized the Fibonnaci sequence, which he used to illustrate the way in which rabbits can multiply rapidly. Johannes Kepler applied mathematics to astronomy, and to the study of the human body. Ren\u00e9 Descartes's Discourse on Method (1637) introduced Cartesian coordinates, which were later used by Isaac Newton to describe planetary motion. The French mathematicien and philosopher Gaspard Monge, a friend of Napoleon, used mathematics to describe the ideal proportions of the female body. The 19th-century German mathematicus Felix Klein was a prolific writer on aesthetics. In more recent times, mathematicians such as Henri Poincar\u00e9, David Hilbert, Henri Lebesgue, and David Mumford have written on the aesthetic aspects of mathematics.\nThe article focus is on the visual art forms.\n",

    "instruction":"Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
    "output_1":" such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional networks, are based sole on encoder-decoder architecture. These models include an RNN encoder, a decoding RNN, and an attention layer to control the decoder to attend to the encodings. The attention mechanism is a simple way to model the interactions between the encoding and decoding. However, these models are not very parallelizable, and they require a lot of time to learn.\nWe propose a simple model, the transformer, which only uses an attention-based encoder. We train the model on two tasks: machine translation (MT) and constituency-parsing. The results show that our model is superior in the quality, and it is more parallel and less time-consuming to train than the previous models.\n",

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

They are composed of many simple neurons that are connected to each other.\nEach neuron has a weight, which determines how much it influences the output of the network. The weights are adjusted through a process called training, which helps the network learn from experience.\nOnce trained, a neural network can be used to make predictions about new data.\nFor",

Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, such that they may be able to solve certain problems in a matter of minutes or seconds that would take a classical computer thousands of years.\nQuantumness is a key concept in quantum computing. Quantumness refers to the fact that quantum particles have properties that are not described by classical physics. For example, a quantum particle can be in two places at the same time, and its behavior can be influenced by other particles even if they are far apart.\nThe main difference between classical and quantum computing is that classical computers use bits (0 or 1) to represent information, while quantum computers use qubits (0, 1, or a combination of both).

Additionally, a paper route provides a more accurate representation of the road conditions and terrain, which can be helpful in making informed decisions about your route.\nThe answer is that some people are more comfortable with paper maps than with GPS devices or smartphones. Some people feel that they have more control over their route when they are using a paper Map. Additionally some people find that paper maps are easier to read and understand than GPS displays. Finally, some people simply prefer",

But more than that, it can help you find your way around the streets and buildings.\nWhen I first started using GPS, I was surprised by how many people who had never heard of the technology. In fact, I had to ask my friends if they had heard of it before I could answer.\nThis is because GPS is a technology that is used to locate objects in the environment.\nIt is used in the navigation of the environment and is also used in navigation of other objects.\nFor example, when you are walking in a city, the map can help guide you to the nearest grocery store or cafe.\nIn contrast, a GSP is a tool that helps you navigate through a city by pointing to objects. For example, if you are standing in a street corner, the GSP can point to objects such as a car or a bus stop.\nA map is a simple way to get from one place to another. It is also a tool to help you navigate in the city and to find your destination.\nThe second reason why people might choose to ask for a map is that they are looking for a place to",

    "output_1":"When it comes to determining whether someone is being genuine or simply polite, it can be difficult to know for sure. However, there are a few things you can look for that may indicate that the person is being sincere.\nFirst, pay attention to the person's body language. If they are leaning in, making eye contact, and smiling, it may be a sign that they are interested in the conversation. Additionally, if the person asks questions and seems engaged in the discussion, they may be genuinently interested.\nFinally, listen to the tone of the person\u2019s voice. If it sounds friendly and open, it is likely that they mean what they say.\nBy observing these signs, you can get a better sense of whether someone truly wants to talk to you or is simply being courteous.\nIs it rude to talk with your mouth full?\nThere is no definitive answer to this question as it is a matter of personal preference. Some people may find it ruder to talk while eating than others, and vice versa.

Local businesses are often small, independently owned businesses that serve the needs of the local community.\nThere are many reasons why people might prefer to support local businesses over large corporations. One reason is that local business owners are more likely to be invested in the community and to care about the people who live there. They are also more likely than large corporate chains to support other local business and organizations.\nAnother reason to support locally owned and operated businesses is that they often have a more personalized and intimate feel than large chains.

    "output_1":"A new study in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests that the same brain mechanisms that underlie fear also play a role in the enjoyment of scary movies and other thrill-seeking activities.\nResearchers at the University of California, Berkeley, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 20 subjects who were shown scary and non-scary movietrailers. The subjects were also asked to rate their level of enjoyment after watching each trailer.\nThe researchers found that the amygdala, a brain region that processes fear and emotional responses, was activated during both the scary trailers and the non-threatening trailers. However, the degree of activation was significantly higher in the amyglada during the scariest trailers, indicating that the subjects were experiencing a higher level of fear.\nInterestingly, the researchers also found that a brain area called the nucleus accumbens, which is involved in reward and pleasure, was also activated in response to the scare.
