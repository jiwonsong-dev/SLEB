    "output_1":"Thanks for the question, and I hope your sister and friends enjoy the game.\nKickball is played with 10 players on the field and 15 players on each team. There are two bases, and four outfielders. The pitcher throws the ball from the pitcher's mound, and the catcher stands behind the plate. The bases are 90 feet apart.\nThe game begins with the first batter on each side. The batter hits the ball, and then runs around the bases. The first base runner can only advance one base on each hit, and must touch each base. The second base runner must also touch each of the bases, but can advance two bases on each play.\nThere are three outs in a game. If the ball is hit into the outfield, the batter is out. If a runner is caught between bases, or if a runner runs out of the designated area, the runner is out, and his team loses a turn at bat.\nIf a runner touches the base and then misses it, he is out on the next play. If he is tagged out, he loses his turn at the plate, and if the next batter hits a home run,",

    "output_2":"A: I have been told that kickball is the most dangerous sport in the world. It's played with a ball that is made of rubber and is shaped like a sphere. The game is similar to soccer, but instead of using a soccer ball, players use a ball made out of rubbers. The ball is thrown by the players and kicked by the coaches. The goal is to kick the ball into the opponent's goal. The team that kicks the ball the most wins the game. The only difference between soccer and kickball are the kickball players use their feet to kick and the soccer players use hands.\nIf you want to play with your sister and friends, you should ask them if they want to join you. If they say yes, then you can play with them and if they say no, then they will probably play with you.\nThe game is easy to play, and you don' t need any special equipment. You can play the game with a small ball and a few friends. The rules of the game are simple. The players kick the balls around the field and try to score as many points as possible. The first team to score 10 points wins the match.",

    "output_1":"In the Middle Ages, many people believed that the Earth was flat, because they could not see the curvature of the Earth from the ground.\nBut in the 16th century, many scientists began to question the belief that the world was flat.\nOne of these scientists was Copernicus, who proposed the heliocentric theory.\nThis theory stated that the sun was at the center of the solar system and that the planets revolved around it.\nThe heliostatic theory was based on the idea that the Sun was the center.\nIt was also based on observations that the Moon and the planes revolved about the Sun.\nCopernicus\u2019s theory was not accepted by everyone.\nSome people thought that the helio-centric theory was wrong because they thought that it was too complicated.\nHowever, Copernican theory was accepted by many people because it explained why the planetesimals were formed.\nHow did Copernic\u2019s helio centric theory come about?\nThe first heliological theory was proposed by Copernics, who argued that the solar systems were formed by the planeteers.\nHe proposed that the planetary systems were created by",

This is a problem, because the planets orbit the sun in elliptically, and the planes of the sun and earth are not perpendicular to each other.\nThis was a problem for the scientific world, as it meant that the sun was not at the center of the universe.\nHowever, this problem was solved by the discovery of the heliocentric universe. This theory was proposed by Johannes Kepler, and was based on the idea that the planeth's orbit around the earth were elliptics, and",

    "output_1":"The use of deep learning for instance segmentations has been a game-changer in the medical imaging industry. However, the performance of these models has been limited by the lack of ground truth data. In this blog post, we will show how to improve the performance by leveraging human knowledge.\nThe first step is to collect data from multiple sources. This can be done by surveying experts or by using crowdsourcing platforms. Once you have collected the data, you need to clean it and prepare it for training. This includes removing outliers and correcting for bias.\nOnce the data is cleaned and prepared, you can start training the model. The most common approach is to use a supervised learning algorithm such as support vector machines or neural networks. However you can also use unsupervised learning algorithms such as k-means clustering.\nAfter training the models, you will need to evaluate their performance. The two most common metrics are accuracy and precision. Accuracy measures how well the model predicts the correct class, while precision measures how often the model correctly predicts a positive class.\nIf you want to improve your instance segment AP metrics, you should start by collecting data from experts and using it to train",

It adds types to JavaScript.\n\n- Types are declared at the top of a file.\n- TypeScript has built-in type inference.\n  - Type inference: TypeScript can determine the type of variables by their context.\n    - For example, if you declare a variable of type `number`, TypeScript will infer that it is a number.\n      - If you declare `let x = 10`, TypeSript will infer `x` is a `number`.\n- If you need to explicitly declare the type, you can do so using the `type` keyword.\n  \n## 2. Explaing Duck typing\n\nDuck typing is a programming paradigm that allows programs to operate on objects without knowing their type.\nThis is achieved by using a duck test, which states that if an object looks like a ducks, it must be a duct.\nIn other words, the type can be determined by the behavior of the object.\n",

Instead, the compiler must be used to determine the type of a value.\nTypeScript is a very flexible language, and it is possible to write code that is more or less TypeScript, depending on the needs of the developer.\nA type can be null if it is declared as a type.\nThe duck rule is a concept in programming that states that a variable can be any type as long as it is a type that can be used in a function.\nIt is possible for a variable in a",

However, it can also be inaccurate because it does not take into account the current state of the world.\nOn the other hand, deep neural networks can be more accurate because they are trained to recognize patterns in large amounts of data.\nHowever, they can also suffer from a lack of interpretability, which can be a problem for some applications.\nDespite the challenges, A.Is. are becoming more and more sophisticated",

The reason for this is that the speed of a swallow in flight is affected by many different factors, including the wind speed, the temperature, and the altitude.\nSo, while it is possible to calculate the air speed of an individual swallow, it is not possible to give a definitive figure for the average speed of all swallow.\nThe question of what is the speed limit for swallows has been asked by many people, and there is no definit answer. Some people believe that swallow flies at a speed of 25 miles per hour, while others believe that it is much slower. There is no scientific evidence to support either claim, so it is difficult to say for sure.\nThere is no one definitive speed limit that swallow flies. The speed limit varies depending on the type of swallow and the conditions in which it is flying.\nSwallow flaps its wings rapidly in order to generate lift and propel itself through the air.

    "output_1":"Asked by lilmissmia1995 16th September 2014, 11:51 AM\nSexual selection is a biological process that occurs when individuals of one sex compete for the attention of individuals of the other sex. The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, states that organisms produce more offspring than can survive. As a result, only the fittest survive and the offspring inherit the traits of the parents. However, the theory does not explain how traits are selected for.\nScientists have proposed several theories to explain the process of natural selection. One theory, called sexual selection, states the organisms choose mates based on their physical characteristics. In other words, individuals compete to be chosen by the opposite sex.\nFor example, a male peacock has a brightly colored tail that is used to attract a female. The male peahen is not as brightly coloured as the male and has a duller tail. The peacoccks have evolved to be brightly-coloured as this attracts the females.\nTags: sexual-selection\nThe theory of natural Selection is",

Landladies usually have a team of staff who help them run their properties. They may also have their own businesses, such as a restaurant or a hotel. Land owners are men who own land. They often have large estates and may have multiple properties.\nWhy are landlads considered superior?\nThere are many reasons why landlads are considered superior. They have a better understanding of the real estate market and are more likely to be able to find a good deal on a property. They also tend to be more organized and",

    "instruction":"The wireless Internet signal in my house is weak in some rooms.  How can I improve my Wi-Fi coverage?",
    "output_1":"Wireless networks are limited by the laws of physics.  In general, the further you are from the access point, the weaker the signal.  This is because the radio waves travel in a straight line.  If you are located on the opposite side of the house from the router, the radio signal is weak.  You can try to move the router closer to the area of the home that is having trouble, but this may not work if the walls are thick.  The best solution is to use a repeater.  A repeater is a wireless access point that rebroadcasts the signal from the original router.  It will extend the range of the original signal and provide better coverage.  There are several types of repeaters available.  Some are plugged directly into the router and are called powerline repeaters.  Others are standalone devices that are plug-and-play.  They are called mesh repeaters because they create a mesh network.  Mesh networks are very popular for home use because they provide more coverage than powerline or standalone repeaters and are easy to install.  We recommend using a mesh repeater if you have a large home and you need to improve your Wi-FI coverage.",

If you want to improve wireless coverage, you can use a wireless repeater.  A repeater is a wireless device that receives a wireless signal and retransmits it.  There are several types of repeaters.  You can buy repeaters that plug into an electrical outlet.  Or you can buy a repeater that plugs into your computer and connects to the Internet via a cable.  Repeaters are easy to use.  They plug into a wall socket and connect to your wireless network with a cable or a wireless connection.  Some repeaters are designed to connect to a router.  Other repeaters connect to the computer or laptop that is connected to your network.\nIf you are using a repeaters, it is important to place the repeater in the best location to improve coverage.

The problem is that the showrunners and writers are trying to do too many things at once.\nThe first season is set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, which means it\u2019s 3,000 years before the events of The Lord of The Ring. This is a time when the Elves are still young and powerful, and the Dwarves are at the height of their powers.\nHowever, the show\u2019s writers are also trying to set up the events that will lead to the Third Age, which begins with the destruction of N\u00famenor. This means that the writers are constantly trying to juggle two different timelines, which makes it difficult to focus on any one story.\nAnother problem is the show is trying to be too faithful to Tolkien\u2019s original works. This leads to a lot of slow pacing and long scenes of people talking.\nIn addition, the characters are all very one-dimensional. There are no real villains or heroes, just people who",

The show is a bit too long and there are too many characters, but the second season is better and I think it'll get better. I'll watch the second and the third season, but I'd like to see the show go out with a bang.\nI agree with you. I think the show is too long. I don't like the way the characters are portrayed. I feel like they're just there to get the story moving. I also think the characters could use more development. I like the show, but if I had to choose between two shows that are in the same genre, I'l pick the second one.\nAfter the second episode, I was like, \"I don' t like this show, I don t like the characters,",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

    "instruction":"Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
    "output_1":"Artists have also contributed to mathematics. Leonardo Fibonacci introduced the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system to Europe, and his Liber Abaci (1202) popularized the Fibonnaci sequence, which he used to illustrate the way in which rabbits can multiply rapidly. Johannes Kepler applied mathematics to astronomy, and to the study of the human body. Ren\u00e9 Descartes's Discourse on Method (1637) introduced Cartesian coordinates, which were later used by Isaac Newton to describe planetary motion. The French mathematicien and philosopher Gaspard Monge, a friend of Napoleon, used mathematics to describe the ideal proportions of the female body. The 19th-century German mathematicus Felix Klein was a prolific writer on aesthetics. In more recent times, mathematicians such as Henri Poincar\u00e9, David Hilbert, Henri Lebesgue, and David Mumford have written on the aesthetic aspects of mathematics.\nThe article focus is on the visual art forms.\n",

For example, the Baroque artist Gian Antonio Cigoli (1601\u20131670) is said to have created the first painting that uses perspective to create a 3D effect. The trompe-l'oeil style, in which paintings are made to look like real things, was used to great effect in the 17th century by the Dutch painter Frans van Mieris and others.\nThe 19th century saw the introduction of a number of new techniques in the arts. The Lumi\u00e8re brothers demonstrated the first public demonstration of a colour motion picture projection using the chronophotograph, and the first colour photograph (colour photograph) was produced in 1881. The first colour television transmission was made in 24 November 1316 in 405-line NTSC analogue colour, using a rotating wheel with a filter for each colour of the colour wheel.\nIn 1568, the first commercial production of a silver-based colour photograph was achieved by Thomas Edison, who patented the first light bulb.\nHowever, colour photographs were not widely",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

However, these models are not very parallelizable, and they require a lot of time to learn.\nWe propose a simple model, the transformer, which only uses an attention-based encoder. We train the model on two tasks: machine translation (MT) and constituency-parsing. The results show that our model is superior in the quality, and it is more parallel and less time-consuming to train than the previous models.\n",

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

    "instruction":"Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

They are composed of many simple neurons that are connected to each other.\nEach neuron has a weight, which determines how much it influences the output of the network.

    "output_1":"What are the applications of quantum computers?\nWhy is quantum computing so difficult?\nHow does a quantum computer work?\nQuantum computing is a form of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, such that they may be able to solve certain problems in a matter of minutes or seconds that would take a classical computer thousands of years.\nQuantumness is a key concept in quantum computing. Quantumness refers to the fact that quantum particles have properties that are not described by classical physics. For example, a quantum particle can be in two places at the same time, and its behavior can be influenced by other particles even if they are far apart.\nThe main difference between classical and quantum computing is that classical computers use bits (0 or 1) to represent information, while quantum computers use qubits (0, 1, or a combination of both). Qubits can be entangled, which means that they can interact with each other even if the particles are far away from each other.\nOne of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing is in the",

    "output_2":"Quantum computing is a relatively new technology that is still being developed and improved. It is based on the idea that quantum mechanics can be used to solve problems that are too complex for classical computers to solve.\nQuantium computing is based off of the idea of superposition. This means that a quantum system can be in multiple states at the same time. This is called quantum superposition and it is a property of quantum systems that is not possible with classical systems.\nThe reason that quantum computing is so powerful is because it can use this property to solve complex problems. For example, a quantum computer can solve a problem that would be impossible for a classical computer to solve because it would require too many calculations.\nAnother reason that makes quantum computers powerful is that they can use quantum entanglement to solve more complex problems than classical computers can solve. This allows them to solve many more problems than a classical computers could solve. For this reason, quantum computers are much faster than classical ones and they can solve problems much faster.\nOne of the most important things to understand about quantum computers is that the data that is stored on the quantum computer is stored in a quantum state.

I do use it to see if there is a detour that I might not know about. I also like to know what is ahead of me. I have never had a problem with a paper maps.\nAnswered by GPS Expert: A GPS is a great tool for navigating to a specific location, but it does not always provide the most efficient route to your destination. A paper map allows you to plan your route in advance, and to make adjustments along the way. It also allows you the flexibility to explore new areas or take detours if desired. Additionally, a paper route provides a more accurate representation of the road conditions and terrain, which can be helpful in making informed decisions about your route.\nThe answer is that some people are more comfortable with paper maps than with GPS devices or smartphones. Some people feel that they have more control over their route when they are using a paper Map. Additionally some people find that paper maps are easier to read and understand than GPS displays.

However, there are a few things you can look for that may indicate that the person is being sincere.\nFirst, pay attention to the person's body language. If they are leaning in, making eye contact, and smiling, it may be a sign that they are interested in the conversation. Additionally, if the person asks questions and seems engaged in the discussion, they may be genuinently interested.\nFinally, listen to the tone of the person\u2019s voice. If it sounds friendly and open, it is likely that they mean what they say.\nBy observing these signs, you can get a better sense of whether someone truly wants to talk to you or is simply being courteous.\nIs it rude to talk with your mouth full?\nThere is no definitive answer to this question as it is a matter of personal preference.
